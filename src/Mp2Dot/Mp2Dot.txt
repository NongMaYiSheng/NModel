Model Program to Dot

mp2dot is a substitute or replacement for mpv (model program viewer)
that does not depend on GLEE.  It does not even depend on
Windows.Forms, so it should build and run on non-Windows
implementations of the CLI such as Mono.

mp2dot is a command-line program with no graphical user interface.  It
produces an output file in the dot language which must be processed by
other programs, such as dot and GSview, to produce graphic output.

mp2dot accepts all the same command line options as mpv, so it can
accept exiting mpv response files.

In addition to all the mpv options, mp2dot supports two more:
/dotFileName and /machineFileName.  These two options achieve the same
effect as the Save as Dot... and Save as FSM... options in the mpv GUI
(from the Save as image... toolbar menu).  If the option is absent,
that file is not written.

mp2dot writes exploration statistics to the console, even when
no output files are requested, as in this example:

C:\NModel\mp2dot\bin>mp2dot @mpv_safety_liveness.txt
  121 states
  239 transitions
    2 accepting states
   61 dead states
    4 unsafe states


Options

[/dotFileName:<string>]
File where the dot output is saved. If this option is absent, no dot
output is written.  (Short form: /dot)

[/machineFileName:<string>] 
File where the FSM is saved.  If this option is absent, no FSM
output is written.  (Short form: /machine)


Release notes (for change set of 17 Aug 2008)

To add mp2dot, these new source files are added to the NModel distribution:

src/Mp2Dot/Program.cs

src/NModel/Utilities/Mp2DotCommandLine.cs, Mp2DotGraphView.cs, 
and Mp2DotGraphView.Settings.cs 

The Visual Studio .sln and .csproj files have not been changed in this
change set, so the new files are not included in the projects and are
not included in the build.  You must add the files to the projects
yourself in order to build mp2dot.exe.

Some mpv options have no effect in this version of mp2dot: 
/combineActions+   /loopsVisible-  /mergeLabels+
